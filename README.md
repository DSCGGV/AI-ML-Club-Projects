# Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Club

## About
The AI/ML Club is a technical organization of students in the campus of [Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya](http://www.ggu.ac.in/), that works under the parent community namely
[Developer Student Clubs](https://dsc.community.dev/guru-ghasidas-vishwavidyalaya/)

## Vision
The ML/AI Club serves as a place of community for discussing, learning about, and working on topics related to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence across disciplines. 
Meeting activities include discussions of current events in AI, professor talks, tutorials, and workshops. The club is also a hub for project work in ML and AI . 
Members can form teams to work on projects like programming competitions and online courses outside of regular meeting times, and then share their progress with the 
rest of the club during regular meetings.

## Our Resources
